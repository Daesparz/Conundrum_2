Holiday Hoodies

The second Conundrum is here!

A company has separate datasets for the 2016 and 2015 numbers and needs to compare a subset of 2016â€™s numbers with the numbers from 2015.

Given the two datasets "orders_2015" and "orders_2016", create a single visualization that answers the question, "Did we sell more Hoodies in 2016 than in 2015 in the first 25 days of December?"
